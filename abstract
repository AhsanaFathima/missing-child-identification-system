• In India a countless number of children are reported missing every year. Among the missing child cases a large percentage of children remain untraced. This project presents a novel use of deep learning methodology for identifying the reported missing child from the photos of multitude of children available, with the help of face recognition.
• The public/user can upload photographs of suspicious child into a common portal with landmarks and details. The police officers/authority can view the details of the missing children. The photo will be automatically compared with the registered photos of the missing child from the repository. Classification of the input child image is performed and photo with best match will be selected from the database of missing children.
• For this, a deep learning model is trained to correctly identify the missing child from the missing child image database provided, using the facial image uploaded by the public/users. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a highly effective deep learning technique for image based applications is adopted here for face recognition. Face descriptors are extracted from the images using a pre-trained CNN model VGG face deep architecture.
